# SBA 320H - React Web Application Project

Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Description

Now, it is time for you to put everything you've learned to the test and apply it to a practical web application.

The content, context, and objective of your application is entirely up to you. Be creative, and think of something that will both allow you to demonstrate the skills you've acquired thus far and solve a need (practical or fictional).

Once you have an idea for your project, keeping the below requirements and resources in mind, speak to your instructor to have your project approved before you begin. This will ensure you're on the right track from the start, and not running into unforseen issues or wasting time on something that will not satisfy the assignment's objectives.

## Your application must meet these requirements to pass (this it your Minimum Viable Product):
* Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, REACT, and Redux Toolkit.
* Hosted on Heroku or Netlify.
* Frequent commits to GitHub.
* A README.md file in your GitHub repository with:

* Explanations of the technologies used.
* Explanations of the approach taken.
* A link to your live site.
* Usage instructions, if relevant.
* Unsolved problems.
* etc.
* Use AJAX to make a request to an external data source like OMDBapi, and insert some of the data retrieved into the DOM.

## Objectives
* Create a server application with Node, Express, and MongoDB.
* Create a CRUD API using Express and MongoDB.
Create MongoDB indexes.
* Use MongoDB indexing to make efficient queries.
* Create MongoDB validation rules.
* Use MongoDB validation to ensure data consistency.
