# SBA 320H - React Web Application Project

Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Description

This SBA is to put everything we have learned to the test and apply it to a practical web application.

The content, context, and objective of the application is entirely up to the developer. We are asked to be creative, and think of something that will both allow us to demonstrate the skills we have acquired thus far and solve a need (practical or fictional).


## The application must meet these requirements to pass as a Minimum Viable Product:
* It is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, REACT, and Redux Toolkit.
* It is hosted on Heroku or Netlify.
* There are frequent commits to GitHub.
* A README.md file is in GitHub repository with: Explanations of the technologies used, Explanations of the approach taken, A link to the live site, Usage instructions, if relevant, Unsolved problems etc.
* Use AJAX to make a request to an external data source like OMDBapi, and insert some of the data retrieved into the DOM.

## Objectives
* Create an application with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Redux Toolkit.
* It is not required but try to have one or more complex user interface modules such as a carousal, drag and drop and a sticky nav, tooltips etc.
* Look into localstorage to see if the data can be saved to the user's browser
* Use an API to create the application. The API can be anything of your choice or from the list provided.
